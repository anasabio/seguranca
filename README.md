# 👥 Java User Registration System 💻

This is a simple and functional project developed in Java that simulates a user registration system through the terminal. Using an interactive menu, users can add people with name, email, and age, list all registered users, and search for users by name. It applies solid Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure clarity, structure, and ease of use.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Register users with name, email, and age  
📋 List all registered users  
🔍 Search users by name  
❌ Exit the program safely

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Java (version 8+)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ArrayList for dynamic data storage
- Terminal-based user interface

## 💻 How to Run

1. Compile the Java files:  
   `javac Main.java`

2. Run the system:  
   `java Main`

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Usuario.java`: Class representing a user with name, email, and age.  
- `Cadastro.java`: Class responsible for storing and managing the list of users.  
- `Main.java`: Main class that contains the menu and user interaction logic.

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Data persistence (files or databases)  
- Graphical User Interface using JavaFX or Swing  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Unit and integration testing
